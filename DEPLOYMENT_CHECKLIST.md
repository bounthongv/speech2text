### üìã Step-by-Step Upload Process:

1. **Create .gitignore file** (if not exists):
```
# Environment variables
.env
.env.local
.env.production

# Python cache
__pycache__/
*.pyc
*.pyo
*.pyd

# Virtual environment
venv/

usage_data.json
users.json
uploads/
results/
temp/

# IDE
.vscode/
.idea/

# OS
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db
```

2. **Initialize Git Repository**:
```bash
git init
git add .gitignore
git add .
git commit -m "Initial deployment - Speech Recognition App"
```

3. **Create GitHub Repository**:
- Go to github.com
- Click "New Repository"
- Name: `speech-recognition-app` (or your preferred name)
- Make it PUBLIC (easier for Railway)
- Don't initialize with README (you already have files)

4. **Push to GitHub**:
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/speech-recognition-app.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## ‚òï BMC Setup Process:

### Step 1: Create Buy Me a Coffee Account
1. Go to https://buymeacoffee.com
2. Sign up with email
3. Choose username (examples for Lao Speech Recognition):
   - `lao-speech`
   - `laospeechapp`
   - `lao-transcribe` 
   - `bounthong-lao`
   - `laospeechrecognition`

### Step 2: Set Up Profile
1. Add profile description:
   ```
   "Support my free speech-to-text application! 
   Your support helps keep the service running and adds unlimited usage."
   ```
2. Set supporter goals
3. Add thank you message
4. Note your username for deployment

## üöÇ Railway Deployment:

### Step 1: Railway Setup
1. Go to https://railway.app
2. Sign up with GitHub account
3. Click "New Project"
4. Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"
5. Choose your repository

### Step 2: Environment Variables
Set these in Railway dashboard:

**REQUIRED:**
```
SECRET_KEY=your-super-secret-production-key-here
FLASK_ENV=production
BMC_USERNAME=your-actual-bmc-username
```

**OPTIONAL (with defaults):**
```
FREE_TIER_MINUTES=60
EMAIL_TIER_MINUTES=240
```

### Step 3: Generate Production Secret Key
Run this in Python to generate secure key:
```python
import secrets
print(secrets.token_urlsafe(32))
```
